# Project-Val-Recolor

(WIP)  
Python program to edit colors of parts of video that stand out.  
Mainly written to change variants of Guns in Videos clipped from Valorant.  
  
# How to Run  

Name your video **vid.mp4** and paste it into the main folder.   
Run **run_me.py**.  
**mask.png** is the mask where the code runs over.  

**resultv.mp4** is the output video with the edit done.  



# 
For now the variables are set to change Pink_BlastX -> Spectrum  
Modes to select Input gun and Output gun will be added later.  
Check the **wiki** out to know how everything was made/ how it works.
